								<span style="font-size:14px;">Swasth Mantra’s  special therapeutic packages include remedies for pain, obesity, and life style modifications, all under one package, and that too within a specific time limit.  After a yearlong research we are privileged to introduce these therapeutic packages for the first time in Kolkata. </span>
								<br><br>
								
								<h2> OBESITY AND KNEE PAIN Package ( TOK) </h2>
								<p>
									This package is for those who are suffering from knee pain and obesity simultaneously and want to get out of this with a single effort. The tenure of the package is for TWO MONTHS and  you can reduce 6 kgs to 8 kgs of body weight , 4 ‘ to 6 ‘ inch of waist circumference along with significant reduction of pain.
									
								</p>
							
								<h2> OBESITY AND BACK PAIN   ( TOB)</h2>
								<p>
									Similar to the TOK package, this is for those who are suffering from Back pain and obesity and an associated ever increasing waistline simultaneously. This is an opportunity to get out of this situation at one go. The tenure of the package is for TWO MONTH and  you can reduce 6 kg to 8 kg of body weight , 4 ‘ to 6 ‘ inch of waist circumference with a great deal of reduced back pain.

								<h2> SHOULDER REHAB PACKAGE ( TSR )</h2>
								<p>
									This package is for those people who are suffering from adhesive capsulitis - a sub variety of the so called “frozen shoulder.”   The duration of the package is 3 MONTHS and physiotherapy treatment is included in its fold too. During this period we always find significant reduction of pain and major improvement in the mobility of the shoulder.
								</p>
							  
								<h2> NECK PAIN & POSTURE CORRECTION PACKAGE ( TNP)</h2>
								<p>
									This package is targeted for those individuals who are suffering from neck, upper back and arm pain. People on the computer or on desk job for long durations generally have a bad posture and a chronic neck pain. This 2 MONTH package would help to improve neck posture and reduce neck pain along with an improved fitness level of the whole body.
								</p>
								
								<h2> WEEKLY VISIT OBESITY AND KNEE PAIN PACKAGE  (   THK )  </h2>
								<p>
									This package is for those people who are not able to avail  facilities on a regular basis  but still want to get rid of obesity and knee pain simultaneously. The tenure of the package is for TWO MONTHS and  you can reduce 4 kg to 6 kg of body weight, 4 ‘ to 6 ‘ inch of waist circumference along with significant reduction of pain. Outstation patients and local patients who are unable to attend the centre regularly would benefit largely from this facility.
								</p>
								
								<h2> OSTEPPOROSIS CORRECTION & LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION PAKAGE (TOL)</h2>
								<p>
									This unique package is for the aged and osteoporotic population of our society who also suffer from associated medical and physical conditions too. It is a 12 MONTH package where the individual goes through a complete transformation- physically, physiologically and mentally. By the end of the package the individual becomes significantly stronger and the posture gets corrected. Balance improves and bone strength improves too.
