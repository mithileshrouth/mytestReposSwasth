							<h3>Knee pain and obesity</h3>
							<p>We, the inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent are high risk individuals for having knee arthritis. We are genetically prone to it. For this reason knee pain seem to be a household condition nowadays. In our society, the incidence of knee osteoarthritis is very high indeed.  On the other hand, people living in cities and enjoying a modern lifestyle are prone to being overweight.
							</p><br>
							<p>This combination of being overweight and having knee pain seems to go hand in hand.  Here, there & everywhere you find people having difficulty walking & climbing stairs….and most of these people are overweight. The combination is disastrous.</p>

									The cornerstone of non surgical knee pain management is medication, physiotherapy and exercises.  We spend thousands of rupees to get us treated for our knee pain. We are advised to continue some basic exercises at home….which most of us gradually forget over time. Ultimately we end up with the doctors once again in a year or two….again spending a few thousand rupees.<br><br>
									In order to have a lasting effect, only physiotherapy does not work. One HAS to manage the obesity and general fitness too. Body weight needs to be controlled, overall fitness level has to improve, muscle mass has to increase. Only then does the effect of the treatment of knee pain give a lasting and significant result.  It’s a lifestyle modification.<br><br>
									But to reduce the bodyweight of a person who has knee osteoarthritis is a difficult affair. Especially so if the person is middle aged or above, never has had much experience of serious exercises in the past and who has been advised not to walk or climb stairs. How does he/she reduce his/her bodyweight without walking??<br><br>
									And this is when you need the intervention of the experts. People who have been into pain management and physiotherapy along with weight management and fitness improvement since the last 20 years approximately. At swasth mantra we know our job… and that too, quite well. The thousands of successfully treated patients are testimony to our claims. We have treated patients with knee pain and have managed obesity separately as well as in combination. Our KNEE PAIN AND OBESITY control program in one of our most successful packages….specially aimed for those unfortunate people who are at a loss about what to do. We manage the pain, improve your fitness and reduce your body weight… without hurting your knees.  For that matter, we have treated numerous post operative cases and the fraternities of medical doctors and surgeons have placed their faith on us. They refer us their post operative patients too. We feel blessed to be able to live up to their expectations. <br><br>
									So, what’s keeping you waiting?? Let’s get going.  Let’s get slim, fit and PAINFREE..…medically.

							<h3>Back pain and obesity</h3>
							<p>The title of this article is a misnomer. Rather, we could have named the article-
								 <b>‘BACK PAIN, OBESITY AND AN EVER-INCREASING WAISTLINE’. </b>
								Back pain is the gift of our modern lifestyle. And even more so are obesity and a bulging waistline. The ever increasing automation and a gradually increasing sedentary lifestyle are gifting us this condition…and the number of patients are increasing day by day. Increase in waistline and back pain nearly goes hand in hand.
								 </p><br>
							<p>Generally majority of back pains recover TEMPORARILY with some medication, rest, physiotherapy and exercises. And with some long term precautions like ‘do not lift weights, do not stoop, do not sit for long duration…especially on a sofa’ etc. 
							<span id="more_click2" style="color:red;cursor:pointer;"> <b>More...</b></span>

									85% of back pains recede.....only to return after some time. And during this period of remission the person leads a somewhat scared and restricted lifestyle. But you cannot forgo stooping altogether during your daily lifestyle. Occasionally you do something which you are not supposed to and there comes back your back pain once again. The whole rigmarole restarts and the back pain once again recedes….only to leave you further frightened of another recurrence.<br><br>
									I ask you…. What is treatment all about if it asks you to lead a restricted life? If after treatment one cannot resume an ACTIVE, PAINFREE & VIBRANT lifestyle, then what’s the use of such treatment? Treatment of any kind should put you back where you should be…. It’s no fair for a person to lead a life of a person 15 years older than him/her just for the fear that the back pin might relapse.
									Treatment should let you be free….it should liberate you. <br><br>
									We at swasth mantra believe so…. We follow methods of treatments which do not restrict a back pain sufferer to the life of a handicapped. He should not be fearful of simple stooping or lifting weights. Rather, we enable them. We enable them to lift, to squat with ease, to play and jog, we enable them to go for a trekking vacation. <br><br>
									We start off with basic pain management with various physiotherapeutic methods, mobilizations etc in coordination with orthopaedic specialists and physicians. As the pain improves, we progress with exercises and stretches and aim to improve the  fitness level of the individual. At the same time we start programmes to reduce bodyweight and tone his/her waistline. We improve the core stability very scientifically. And all of this under strict medical supervision and guidelines. So that after a period of time the back pain patient now discovers the lean, fit and slim individual hidden inside. And best of all, now he/she is PAINFREE.<br><br>
									We enable them to be discovering a younger avatar…. as if they were about 10 years younger… full of vigor and energy.

							<h3>Biomechanical Screening</h3>
							<p>Biomechanical Screening is a process through which an examination of the muscle and the joints are conducted in order to determine the body segments which needs to be trained. This can have a dramatic effect in improving your sports and fitness performance or a rehabilitation program by customizing your training schedule. The workout chart which would be generated from this Biomechanical Screening would enable you to accomplish your goals by preventing injury and optimizing sports and fitness performance. </p><br>
							<p>A lot of injuries occur in our life because of bad posture or due to over-enthusiastic activities at the gym and sports. This is because before starting off, no initial assessment is done by a proper medical person and therefore the training programme turns out to be an unplanned activity. Chances of injury are very high. If the person has some amount of spondylosis or arthritis in his/her spine/ knees etc, then there is every possibility of the pain and symptoms to increase. With faulty exercises the amount of arthritis is bound to increase too.

									In order to counteract this, at SWASTH MANTRA, all individuals undergo a MANDATORY BIOMECHANICAL SCREENING by qualified Orthopaedic and Sports Physiotherapists. A specific format of assessment is followed which has been created after years of research by our R&D team. All Physiotherapists who are assigned to do this assessment undergo a special training for the same.  The mechanical anomalies and defects which remain concealed inside our bodies are all identified and quantified. This Biomechanical Screening categorizes all the joints which are stiff or hyper-mobile. It spots all major muscles which might pose to be causes of injuries and pain. <br><br>
									 After every Biomechanical Screening the individual is given a total score of his/her health condition… we call it the HEALTH ASSETT VALUE (HAV). It is the score your body achieves after the assessment of your mobility, joint range, core stability etc. In short it’s a numerical value of your level of physical fitness and your risk of injury. <br><br>
									In accordance to this assessment, a customized exercise programme is chalked out. Body segments which need special attention are focused on, along with the regular workout schedule. Gym Trainers undergo regular workshops to meet these exercise standards. 
									After specific periods, the Biomechanical Screening is once again repeated. And in almost ALL cases we find a significant improvement. The HAV score improves. This actually quantifies the improvement which your total self has undergone by your association with us at Swasth Mantra.
									So, let’s join hands to get SLIM, FIT AND PAINFREE...…MEDICALLY, with the help of our Biomechanical Screening and HAV report guided scientific exercise programmes.
									Swasth Mantra enables you to improve and be healthier. It’s a lifetime association for being painfree and healthy. <br><br>
