The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.

							<p>
								A 51 year plump housewife having knee pain on climbing stairs and on prolonged standing reported to SWASTH MANTRA. She complained of occasional swelling and exacerbation of knee pain which responds to simple rest or minimal pain killers. She has had physiotherapy treatment a couple of times in the past at  various places….and had responded well. But the pain has never left her. Her x rays showed early varus and osteo arthritis of the knees. End extension was painful and she had loss of about 20* of end flexion in both knees. Patellar mobility was reduced with painful crepitus. 
								She was advised to join the KNEE PAIN & OBESITY PACKAGE at SWASTH MANTRA. A two month programme was chalked out. After the detailed assessment (which included a biomechanical assessment too), regular physiotherapy was started and along with it plenty of core exercises were given. Diet counseling’s were started too. 
								By the end of two months Mrs. Biswas was leaner by 9 kgs, her lower limb strength had increased and she could achieve full knee extension. VAS score showed significant reduction of pain. Standing time had increased too.
								She was advised to repeat the same programme which she did willingly.
								By the end of the second package she had lost 15 kgs and had achieved full knee flexion. Stair climbing was easy for her now and so was squatting. She was advised not to squat or stair climb regularly and to maintain proper knee care. She thereafter shifted to a basic maintenance package and is presently maintaining her body weight and knee strength.
								She is comfortable and smiling. Her knee pain no longer restricts her lifestyle. In her words…”I can now chase my mischievous grandson up the stairs without even thinking twice!!”

							<p>
								Mrs. Kaur, a 49 year old bigly built and obese lady having significant knee pain and limping, had consulted various Orthopaedic Surgeons in the city. Advice varied from NSAIDs (painkillers) to knee replacement. Coming from a family of doctors, she was against knee replacement at such a premature age…and logically so. Regular painkiller consumption was neither a good option. 
								She then consulted Dr. Debasis Chatterjee, one of the most qualified Orthopaedic Surgeons in Kolkata, and was advised HTO (high tibial osteotomy)- a surgery to correct the progressive bowing of the knees - and thus slow down the progression of arthritis. A requisite of the surgery was reduction of bodyweight and regular exercises later in life – which the patient agreed to.
								She underwent the surgery and after the mandatory recuperative phase, Dr Chatterjee referred her to SWASTH MANTRA.
								A detailed biomechanical screening was conducted and our consultant orthopaedic physiotherapist assessed her post operative status. Physiotherapy and electrotherapy was started along with body weight reduction methods. Diet counseling was done.
								After 2 months of training her knee pain and body weight had not reduced significantly. Dr Chatterjee reviewed the patient and once again referred her for continuation of the programme.  Thus the schedule was repeated. But this time Psychological counseling was done to improve her motivation (which she lacked significantly). She restarted the programme with fresh zeal.
								After the second tenure, she improved significantly. Her bodyweight reduced by about 10 kgs and her knee regained near full range. Pain was significantly reduced and her limp was nearly gone.
								Mrs. Kaur, her family members, Dr Chatterjee and the SWASTH MANTRA team were all smiles.
								She had been saved from an impending total knee replacement at an early age.

							<p>
								Mrs. Debolina Sen , a teacher in one of the most reputed schools of Kolkata was suffering from chronic back pain since years. It used to resurface every now and then- forcing her into medication, rest and agony. Occasionally, physiotherapy was also needed. It was during one such situation when she was referred to the physiotherapy clinic of Dr. Prodip Chakraborty for a session of physio for her back pain.
								Being a disciplined patient, she underwent the session and recovered well. During the final review session she put forward her desire to be out of this cycle of occasional pain and treatment cycle. It was at that time that she was advised to join SWASTH MANTRA. She was initially skeptical of the idea, but was ultimately convinced. She joined the OBESITY & BACK PAIN programme. Physiotherapy was continued and general fitness exercises were gradually introduced. To everyone’s delight, she was one of the most motivated and regular members. She followed all instructions to the tee. And by the end of the package, she had reduced about 20 Kgs was significantly slim and toned. The back pain was obviously gone. Her waistline reduced and back mobility improved. 
								It has been about a year now that Mrs. Sen had enrolled with us. To her surprise and as per our expectation, her back pain is now nonexistent. She is maintaining her slim figure and enjoying her new freedom from her constant companion – the nagging pain.
